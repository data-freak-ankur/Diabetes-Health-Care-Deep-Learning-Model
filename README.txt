Problem Statement: 

Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates:Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records


Problem Explanation: 

Management of hyperglycaemia in hospitalized patients has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, there are few national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database (74 million unique encounters corresponding to 17 million unique patients) was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to find future directions which might lead to improvements in patient safety. Almost 70,000 inpatient diabetes encounters were identified with sufficient detail for analysis.
